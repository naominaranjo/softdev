The command “$ python3 -m venv ~\/myherozero” will create a python environment called “myherozero.” Python environments are useful because they can be used to create a self-contained directory, with its own version of python, and any libraries a person might want to use. Certain python programs may require a certain version of a library, or a different version of the language all together. Housing different applications in different environments allows multiple versions of python and python libraries, preventing conflict between different versions of these programs, and letting a single machine run python applications with different requirements. Also “~/” means the python environment is created in the home directory.
