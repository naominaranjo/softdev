K14 -- Form and Function
2021-10-14

* There are two commonly used HTTP request methods: GET and POST. There are
others (like HEAD, PUT, etc.) but they are less common.
* We can access the form values from an HTML form that uses GET requests with
request.args, which is an ImmutableMultiDict with the form input names as keys
and the form values as the values.
* We can "overload" a single endpoint to handle multiple request methods -
Flask will correctly interpret which response function to use depending on the
HTTP request method.
