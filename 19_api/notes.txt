K19: REST APIs
2021-11-24

- When reading key from file, trailing newline needs to be removed first
- API key passed as a query parameter to the url
- API returns information in JSON format
- Using the `requests` library to attempt http get requests to the API url
    - `request.get()` returns the data returned when a get request is called given a url and the query parameters
    - `r.json()` decodes the json data and turns the returned data into a dictionary
    - For instance, the url to the image is stored in the 'hdurl' key and the explanation of the image is in the 'explanation' key
